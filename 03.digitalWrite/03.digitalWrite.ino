  Learning Intention: The students will learn about configuring PINs and how to write binary data to a specific PIN.
  Success Criteria:
    1. I understand how to configure a PIN for outputting data
    2. I know how to write binary data to a specific PIN
    3. I can change the value in the delay method to change time
    4. I understand that LOW = false = 0 = <1.5 volts (or Off) and that HIGH = true = 1 = >3 volts (or On)
    5. I can create and correctly wire a LED in TINKERCAD and prototype my code
    6. I understand that a resistor is needed to reduce the voltage for the LED
    7. I understand what 'static' means before the int declaration
    8. I can organise output data so it correctly plots on the serial monitor
    9. I can apply this knowledge to the LED & Buzzer in the sensor kit
